    DO NOT EXCEED 2^8 ROUNDS OF HASHING!

    1- In order to register a new account the client must provide `username` and `password`:
      {
        "username": "Captain Marvel", // must not exist already in the `users` table
        "password": "foobar"          // needs to be hashed before it's saved
      }

    2- On SUCCESSFUL registration,
      the response body should have `id`, `username` and `password`:
      {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "Captain Marvel",

      }

    3- On FAILED registration due to `username` or `password` missing from the request body,
      the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username and password required".

    4- On FAILED registration due to the `username` being taken,
      the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username taken".
